# Bay-area-bike-share-analysis-using-neural-network
Bay area bike share analysis using Neural nets created using Python and Numpy only. No libraries used for nets.
We analyse the Bay area bike sharing dataset using a neural network and we build one from the ground up using Numpy and Python only.
Everything in the net such as weights, hidden layers, activation function, gradient descent, loss is using pure python.
